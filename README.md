### About

This covers indepth use of the grid system within CSS3. As I work my way through the Traversy Media YouTube archive, I'm coming to the realization that whatever we were being taught in Coding Bootcamp was outdated and simply wrong.

We covered outdated topics like `float`, Bootstrap, jQuery, and never touched on the powerful, modern features like `flex-box` or `grid`. While I still think the boot camp was good for a quick overview of all-things web development, I really think they need to update their material. Thankfully great content creators like Brad Traversy exist to show us the right way to do things.

grid-template-areas:

    "showcase showcase top-box-a"
    "showcase showcase top-box-b";

grid-area: showcase;

.top-box-a {
grid-area: top-box-a;
}

.top-box-b {
grid-area: top-box-b;
}

grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
}

### Acknowledgement

Thanks again to Traversy Media for this great tutorial covering the grid system in CSS. Fascinating and powerful stuff.
